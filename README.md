## Sprint 1 (14.20 - 14.55, 27 Jan 2020)
* Created github repository
* Created user stories:
  * US1: As a User I want to give a time period of the simulation so that I know how many Rabbits are alive at the end of the simulation.
  * US2: As a User I want to know how many rabbits have died by the end of the simulation so that I can analyse how many have died in the time period I have given.
  * US3: As a User I want to know how many male and female rabbits are alive at the end of the simulation so that I can analyse the characteristics of the rabbits that are alive.
  * US4: As a User I want to know the average age of live Rabbits by the end of the simulation so that I can analyse the characteristics of the rabbits that are alive.
